## Overview
**EconomyLite** is a compact and lightweight economy management plugin for PocketMine. Its goal is to provide a simple way to integrate an economy system into your Minecraft server without unnecessary complexity or bloated features, while ensuring stability and customization.

### Key Features:
- **Minimalistic Design**: Simple and focused on core economy features. No intrusive user interface or complicated formatting.
- **Player Accounts**: Automatically manages player accounts for new and existing players.
- **Configurable Economy**: Allows you to configure the starting money, maximum money limit, and more via the configuration files.
- **Administrator Tools**: Includes admin commands to manage player balances, view transaction histories, and monitor the overall economy.
- **Transaction History**: Automatically logs recent payments for players and admins.
- **Localization Support**: All messages can be customized through the `language.yml` file to fit your server's language needs.

## Detailed Features:
1. **Player Account Management**:
    - **Automatic Account Creation**: Player accounts are created automatically when they join the server for the first time.
    - **Configurable Starting Balance**: New players receive a starting balance (configurable in the plugin settings).

2. **Simple Transactions**:
    - Players can transfer money using the `/pay` command.
    - Invalid transactions (e.g., insufficient funds, invalid targets) are gracefully handled.

3. **Command Breakdown**:
    - `/purse`: Shows the player's current balance and the last five transactions (both sent and received).
    - `/pay`: Lets players send money to others, provided they have sufficient balance.

4. **Admin Features**:
    - Manage economy balance:
        - **Add** or **Remove** money from a specific player's account.
        - **Delete** a player account entirely, removing it from the database.

    - Query balance for any player using the `/economylite show` command.
    - Global economy statistics are available using `/economylite info`, such as:
        - Total money in circulation.
        - Recent changes (e.g., added or removed money).

    - Review player payment history through `/economylite history`.

5. **Economy Limits**:
    - Enforces a configurable maximum economy cap to prevent exceeding defined limits.
    - Transactions that surpass the configured money cap are denied to maintain balance.

6. **History and Logging**:
    - Payment history and economy changes are logged internally and can be queried using commands.
    - Admins can retrieve detailed player transaction logs, filtered by limits.

7. **Localization**:
    - All plugin messages are stored in `language.yml`, which supports customization.
    - Default values are restored automatically if keys are missing from the configuration.
